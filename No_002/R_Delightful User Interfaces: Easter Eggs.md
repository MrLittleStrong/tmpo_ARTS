### Notes

This article introduced how netflix used CSS and static images to create an easter egg for fans of  Jessica Jones on Web Browser instead of video or WebGL which would cost a lot in performance. 

### Summary

As a vedio provider, there are indeed a lot of chances to plant Easter eggs to delight their fans. But as a engineer, if I was in this kind of project, I would be interested and  excited, too.  Just as said in article: "Building an experience like this feels very rewarding because we get to be creative and share delight with our customers. The pleasure is ours to create this easter egg to excite fans and build anticipation. "
