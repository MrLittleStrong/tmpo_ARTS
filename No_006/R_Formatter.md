### Notes

This article mainly talked about conversion in iOS.

Basically, seperated in four categories: 

- Numbers and Quantities
- Dates, Times, and Durations
- People and Places
- Lists and Items

### Summary

What impressed me is the RelativeDateTimeFormatter which will come in iOS13. Usually, we have to make a  category to convert timestamp to relative time like "in 1 hour". Finally, there is an official formatter to use.

As to ListFormatter, It still a new thing to me, maybe it will solve me some problems in the future.
