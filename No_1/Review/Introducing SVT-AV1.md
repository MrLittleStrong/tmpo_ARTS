### Notes

Netflix video algorithm team recently combined with Intel's Visual Cloud team to develop SVT-AV1. But compare to H.264, a lot still has to be done to gain the market. 

### Summary

To be honest, this article is beyond my knowledge zone. There are  too many specific words which I need to check online to understand its meaning. Still I do not know some part of it. But it's OK for me. Next time I will choose blog wisely.

By the way, I notice a comment says the Intel team is still maintaining their own repository which raises some doubts that maybe they are not making full effort to cooperate.
