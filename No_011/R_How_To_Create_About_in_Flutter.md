### Notes

There is a kind of tile which is called **AboutListTile** and used in a list.

It has some different properties like applicationIcon, applicationName, applicationVersion and so on. 

When it is clicked, **AboutDialog** will show up and properties of this aboutDialog will be assigned with properties in the AboutListTile. 

Besides, there also is a way to call showAboutDialog directly. Just need to assign the properties.

### Thoughts

As far as I can see, this widget is so limited when using. Maybe it suits small app team or individual as they don't need to design this function.
